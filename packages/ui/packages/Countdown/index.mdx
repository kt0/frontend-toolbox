# Countdown
the countdown component is a useful countdown that gives you customization ability to implement the count down however you want.
the core of the countdown has been implemented in the worker and it communicates with the component using the psotmessage.
also the remaining time renders using the render method of the react-dom instead of updating the state, so there's no worry about the re-rendering  overheads.

<br />

# Import
because of the worker, unlike the other packages, the countdown should be imported this way.
<code>import Countdown from '@snappmarket/ui/Countdown'</code>

<br />

# Basic Usage
<Playground>
  <Countdown date={new Date(Date.now() + (1000 *  60 * 60 * 24 * 10))} />
</Playground>

<br />

# Customization
you can simply pass a children function to customize the timer, it gives you days, hours, minutes and options as the children parameters in an object.

<Playground>
  <Countdown
    date={new Date(Date.now() + (1000 *  60 * 60 * 24 * 10))}
    onStart={date => console.log("start", date)}
    onEnd={date => console.log("start", date)}
  >
    {({days, hours, minutes, seconds}) => (
      <>
        <h3>here is a 10 days countdown</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>days: {days}</li>
          <li>hours: {hours}</li>
          <li>minutes: {minutes}</li>
          <li>seconds: {seconds}</li>
        </ul>
      </>
    )}
  </Countdown>
</Playground>
